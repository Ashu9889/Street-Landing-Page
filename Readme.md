# Street Style Landing Page

This is basically a single page website made in HTML & CSS from scratch , which helped me to learn
and explore various concepts of HTML & CSS . The most intresting thing while working on this project
was that I have bound myself not to use flex box or grid property ,
so that I can have better understanding of positions.
